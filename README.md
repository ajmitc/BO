There is only one way to win the game: assassinate Hitler by
succeeding at a plot attempt. To succeed at the attempt,
you must both roll a number of "targets" on the dice equal to or
exceeding the level of Hitler’s Military Support and roll
fewer "eagles" than your suspicion allows.

However, there are three ways the conspirators lose:
- If all players are in prison, you lose the game.
- If you can’t draw an event card when required to, you lose the game.
- If the Stage 7 event Documents Located is drawn*, you lose the game.
